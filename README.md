# RNA-seq-Analysis
(RNA-seq pipeline used for publication at Chen et. al)

The pipeline aims to streamline processing raw fastq files, sequence alignment, reads counting, and downstream differential analysis, generating publication-ready plots. Most of the analyses are built on top of existing tools and/or packages publicly available. Please find the reference as indicated. Here, the pipeline demonstration consisits of two parts, seqeunce alignment and read count in Bash script (part I) and differential analysis and plotting in R script (Part II):
